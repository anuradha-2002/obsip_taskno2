                    After Jijabai became the queen regent, she moved to Poona to manage her husband’s Jagir there, taking Shivaji with her. In 1666 however, Shivaji left for Agra, leaving Jijabai to manage the affairs of the state. Since then, innumerable events in history went on by in Jijabai’s life, some good, some tragic and painful, yet she silently bore them. The death of her husband brought her great sorrow. Her eldest son Sambhaji being slain by Afzal Khan, whom Shivaji later avenged with Jijabai’s blessings. However, Shivaji’s great conquests like his capture of the Fort of Thorangadh, his several gallant escapades with the Mughals, along with the valiant achievements of heroes like Thanaji, Baji Prabhu, Suryaji, who were also inspired by her, brought a unique feeling to her heart as that of a proud mother. Jijabai’s dream was fulfilled when she witnessed the coronation of her son, Shivaji, as he ascended the golden throne in 1674, to become leader of the legendary Marathas.
